Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection systems.
        Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web for at least one part of the transaction\'s life cycle 
        although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail.
         Typical e-commerce transactions include the purchase of online books (such as Amazon) and music purchases
          (music download in the form of digital distribution such as iTunes Store), and to a less extent,
           customized/personalized online liquor store inventory services.
           
        There are three areas of e-commerce: online retailing, electric markets, and online auctions. E-commerce is supported by electronic business.'

Guarantees and returns are crucial to your ecommerce business because it helps build trust and loyalty among your customers. With an easy to accomplish Return Policy and a Money Back Guarantee in place, you’re eliminating last-second hesitation and sense of risk that may abort the sale, while letting customers know that you got their back.

Implementing a return policy and money back guarantee also shows that you’re confident in your products, which leads to consumer confidence in your brand. Companies who have adopted a no-questions-asked return policy have experienced tremendous growth in such a short amount of time. Zappos is the perfect example of a company that offers a no-frills return policy that puts the customer first, that’s why millions of people are loyal to them.
